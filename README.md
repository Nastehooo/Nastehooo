üöÄ **Aspiring Software Engineer** with a deep passion for solving real-world problems through clean, efficient, and interactive software solutions. I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and the desire to constantly learn and improve ‚Äî whether it's mastering a new framework, optimizing a user interface, or understanding the architecture behind scalable systems.

I specialize in building modern web applications that are not only visually appealing but also accessible, responsive, and performant. I believe great software goes beyond functionality ‚Äî it should offer a seamless and intuitive user experience. That's why I focus on writing clean, maintainable code, designing user-centric interfaces, and integrating meaningful data visualizations into my work.

My current focus is on growing as a full-stack developer, using React.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend to create interactive and scalable applications. I often combine these technologies with Chart.js and Tailwind CSS to build dashboards that bring complex datasets to life.

I‚Äôm especially passionate about working with real-world datasets, particularly in the fields of healthcare, aging, and social science. One of my most recent projects involves developing a data visualization dashboard using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) dataset. It explores trends in state pensions, health metrics, and more through dynamic charts and geographic maps.

As I grow into my role as a developer, I‚Äôm actively seeking opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with other passionate engineers, and continue learning through hands-on experience. My ultimate goal is to build software that doesn‚Äôt just work ‚Äî but makes a real impact.
