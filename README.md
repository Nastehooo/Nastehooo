## 👋 Hi there! I'm [Your Name]

🚀 **Aspiring Software Engineer** with a deep passion for solving real-world problems through clean, efficient, and interactive software solutions. I’m driven by curiosity and the desire to constantly learn and improve — whether it's mastering a new framework, optimizing a user interface, or understanding the architecture behind scalable systems.

I specialize in building **modern web applications** that are not only visually appealing but also accessible, responsive, and performant. I believe that great software goes beyond functionality — it should deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. That's why I focus on writing clear, maintainable code, designing user-centric interfaces, and integrating meaningful data visualizations into my work.

My current focus is on **frontend development**, particularly using **React**, **Chart.js**, and **Tailwind CSS** to bring data to life through interactive dashboards. I'm also working on strengthening my skills in **Java** and **backend fundamentals**, preparing to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.

I love working with **real-world datasets**, especially in the fields of healthcare, aging, and social science. One of my most recent projects involves building a dashboard using data from the **English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA)**, where I visualize trends in state pensions, health metrics, and more through charts and maps.

As I grow into my role as a developer, I’m looking for opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with other passionate engineers, and continue learning through hands-on experience. My goal is to build software that not only works — but **makes a difference**.
